# **Consalio Data Extraction**  

ConsalioDataExtraction is a **Python-based automation tool** designed to streamline the extraction of invoice data from XML files. By eliminating the need for manual data entry, this script enhances efficiency and accuracy, making it easier to process large volumes of invoices seamlessly.  

## **Overview**  

Invoices often come with structured data that need to be extracted and formatted for further processing. This script automates that process by converting **XML invoice files** into structured **Excel templates**, reducing human error and significantly speeding up data imports.  

## **How It Works**  

The script processes **XML invoice files** provided by the user and transforms the extracted data into three distinct **Excel templates**:  

1. **Global Information** – Contains overarching invoice details, such as recipient information, invoice numbers, and total amounts.  
2. **Line Items Information** – Captures individual product or service details, including descriptions, quantities, unit prices, and VAT rates.  
3. **Transactions Information** – Logs transactional details for further financial reconciliation.  

This structured output ensures that data can be imported directly into business systems without manual intervention.  

## **Getting Started**  

To use this script, ensure you have **Python** installed along with the necessary dependencies. Simply provide the required XML files, and the script will handle the rest—automating extraction and generating ready-to-use Excel reports.
